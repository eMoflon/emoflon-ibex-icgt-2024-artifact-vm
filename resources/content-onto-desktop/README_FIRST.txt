This is the evaluation artifact of our ICGT24 submission "Using application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair" by Lars Fritsche, Alexander Lauer, Andy Sch√ºrr and Gabriele Taentzer

ICGT24-ArtifactEvaluation.pdf contains installation details to reproduce our results
icgt24_eval.ova contains the VM that contains a preinstalled eMoflon
paper-evaluation-results-eval/{performance, repairs}.txt contain our own measurements based on the following system: Ryzen 9 3900x, 64GB RAM

Important Note:
After starting the VM and the contained Eclipse, you can execute the benchmark according to the pdf.
However, if the log states that there were too many errors during measurement, please select all projects in your workspace and refresh them.
This will make all generated files visible to Eclipse and solve these errors.
